# Aryeo API Docs

The public API docs for Aryeo.

## Setup

### Generate New Aryeo Docs

The generation and updating of `Aryeo.DOCS.JSON` happens externally.

### Run Locally

These API docs are visualized with [Redoc](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc). To view the docs locally, you must run a web server.

If you have [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed, run the following command:

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

If you have [Python 2](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed, run the following command:

```bash
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

The output after entering the command provides the local URL where the preview can be accessed. To exit the preview, use `control-C`.
